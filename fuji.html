        <h3>Fuji Mountain</h3>
        <p>
          Mount Fuji is an active stratovolcano that last erupted from 1707 to
          1708.[4][5] The mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of
          Tokyo and is visible from there on clear days. Mount Fuji's
          exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about
          five months of the year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan
          and it is frequently depicted in art and photography, as well as
          visited by sightseers and climbers.
